An AI agent that scouts up to 10 globally diverse news portals for your configured topics and
sends you a concise, synthesised daily email report.

## Features

| Requirement | How it is met |
|---|---|
| Scans up to 10 portals per topic | The LLM picks portals at runtime; the agent fetches their RSS feeds |
| Portals chosen by AI, not hardcoded | GPT-4o selects sources based on topic context |
| Global sources (not only Western media) | The prompt explicitly asks for regional and local outlets |
| Easily configurable topics | Edit `config/topics.yaml` – no code changes needed |
| Daily email with summary / trends | `EmailSender` composes an HTML + plain-text email every day |
| GitHub Actions automation | `.github/workflows/news_scout.yml` – scheduled at 08:00 UTC |
| Simple deployment | Fork → set four secrets → done |

## Quick-start: GitHub Actions (recommended)

### 1. Fork this repository

Click **Fork** at the top-right of the GitHub page.

### 2. Configure topics

Edit `config/topics.yaml` in your fork:

```yaml
topics:
  - name: "Middle East Conflict"
    description: >
      Ongoing conflicts, diplomacy, and humanitarian situations
      in the Middle East.

  - name: "Artificial Intelligence"
    description: >
      AI breakthroughs, regulation, safety, and societal impact.
```

Commit and push the change.

### 3. Set up Azure Communication Services (Email)

This project uses **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** for reliable, no-SMTP email delivery.

#### Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed and logged in (`az login`)
- The `communication` CLI extension (installed automatically by the script if missing)

#### Azure CLI setup (recommended)

A ready-to-run script is provided at [`scripts/setup_acs.sh`](scripts/setup_acs.sh).

All configurable values are set through environment variables (shown with their defaults):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RESOURCE_GROUP` | `news-tracker-rg` | Azure resource group name |
| `LOCATION` | `eastus` | Azure region (`az account list-locations -o table`) |
| `ACS_NAME` | `news-tracker-acs` | ACS resource name |
| `EMAIL_SERVICE_NAME` | `news-tracker-email` | Email Communication Service name |

Run the script once:

```bash
# Optional: override defaults via env vars
# export RESOURCE_GROUP="my-rg"
# export LOCATION="westeurope"

bash scripts/setup_acs.sh
```

The script prints the two values you need as GitHub secrets in the next step:

```
ACS_CONNECTION_STRING=endpoint=https://...
ACS_SENDER_ADDRESS=DoNotReply@<subdomain>.azurecomm.net
```

#### Azure Portal setup (optional alternative)

If you prefer a graphical interface:

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), create an **Azure Communication Services** resource.
2. Inside that resource, add an **Email Communication Service** and provision the free `*.azurecomm.net` domain (no DNS changes needed).
3. Link the domain to your ACS resource (**Try email → Connect domain**).
4. Copy the **Connection string** from the ACS resource's **Keys** blade.
5. Note the sender address shown in the portal (e.g. `DoNotReply@<subdomain>.azurecomm.net`).

### 4. Set repository secrets

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret name | Description |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key |
| `EMAIL_TO` | Recipient e-mail address |
| `ACS_CONNECTION_STRING` | ACS resource connection string (from the Keys blade) |
| `ACS_SENDER_ADDRESS` | Verified sender address (e.g. `DoNotReply@<subdomain>.azurecomm.net`) |

#### Optional repository variable

| Variable name | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4o` | Override the OpenAI model (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini` to reduce cost) |

Set this under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**.

### 5. Enable the workflow

The workflow runs automatically at **08:00 UTC** every day.  
To trigger it immediately: **Actions → Daily News Scout → Run workflow**.

## How it works

```
For each topic in config/topics.yaml
  │
  ├─ [LLM] Identify up to 10 globally diverse news portals
  │         (includes regional sources relevant to the topic)
  │
  ├─ [HTTP] Fetch articles from each portal
  │         └─ Try RSS feed  →  auto-discover RSS  →  scrape headlines
  │
  └─ [LLM] Generate a Markdown report with:
            • Executive Summary
            • Key Developments
            • Trends & Analysis
            • Regional Perspectives
            • Notable Sources & Links
│
└─ [ACS]  Send combined HTML email via Azure Communication Services
```
